# Avatar the Last Airbender Memory Game

This is a memory game which will test your ability to remember Avatar the Last Airbender chracters. Ultimately, this is a React web application designed to show my abilities to use the front end framework. This is made entirely with React. 

## Technologies

[React](https://reactjs.org/), JavaScript

## Installation

To install this app. Just clone the repo. Go to your command line in the terminal and run.

```bash
npm i
```

Once all of the dependencies are installed you can run the following command to start the application.

```bash
npm start
```

This will begin the development server. You can make changes as you see fit!

## Notable Features

The game loads the characters from a JSON file. From that data a card is generated for each character. These cards are lined up in aplhabetical order until a user clicks on the first card. At this time they will randomize and change position.

As you play you will notice a banner on top of the game which will change text as you play. 

Also note that when you play your score will increase. Once you hit a wrong character it will reset your score to 0 and you highscore will remain.
